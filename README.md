# Smart IoT World

Welcome to **Smart IoT World** – a repository for various **IoT projects** developed by **CodeCrood**. This repository aims to build and deploy **smart automation solutions** using multiple platforms, including **React** for frontend user interfaces, **Node.js** for server-side logic, **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** for sensor and actuator control, and **Raspberry Pi** for machine learning applications.

Each project in this repository focuses on different aspects of IoT systems, allowing for a variety of use cases, from smart home automation to machine learning-based predictions and controls.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a modular structure where each project consists of the following components:

- **Frontend (React)**: The user interface (UI) is built using React for both web and mobile applications, providing an interactive and responsive experience for controlling IoT devices.
- **Backend (Node.js)**: The backend server handles HTTP requests, processes data, and communicates with IoT devices.
- **Hardware (NodeMCU, Raspberry Pi, Sensors, Actuators)**: Various hardware platforms, including **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** for connecting sensors/actuators and **Raspberry Pi** for more advanced applications like machine learning.
- **Machine Learning**: Some projects leverage the power of **Raspberry Pi** to run machine learning algorithms for real-time predictions, anomaly detection, or other advanced tasks.
